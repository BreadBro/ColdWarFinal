I made this game as a final project for my history class on Cold War as a junior. Though it's not necessarily impressive, this was one of my first bigger projects and 
definitely holds a special place in my heart. I ran into a lot of problems in this project which for sure increased my capacity as a coder.

In this game, you play as a CIA agent attempting to defeat Fidel Castro, which was my necessary reference for a Cold War class. The CIA agent shoots "bullets" (black 
rectangles) and can switch to larger, slower exploding cigars (brown, wider rectangles). Castro has multiple attacks, ranging from tracking balls that deal damage to
zoning attacks that force the player into specific areas of the map. Downfalls of this game are that I intentionally did not put a timer between shooting bullets
so that I could defeat Castro quicker for my in class demonstration of the project, and Castro's movement is rather simple (randomly moving back in forth). Enjoy this
game if y'all actually end up playing it.
